# Sports Detection

Comparison of machine learning models of sports type. 
I would like to show which one of these has the highest accuracy with the same size of dataset and with similar settings.
In this project I used Python language and Tensoflow, Keras, Pandas, Numpy packages.

# Result of the best model
The best model is CNN. The efficency for training data was about 80% and for the test data about 64%. The training time of such model is about 1100 seconds with 50 epochs.
Below are the results of the confusion matrix:
